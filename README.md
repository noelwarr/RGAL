What is RGAL?
=============

RGAL is a ruby wrapper for a small portion of the awsome [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) library.  It is written using [Rice](http://rice.rubyforge.org/) which makes it really easy to extend.

main currently wrapped packages:

- 2D Polygon
- 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations
- 2D Straight Skeleton and Polygon Offsetting
- 3D Polyhedral Surface
- 3D Boolean Operations on Nef Polyhedra
- 3D Minkowski Sum of Polyhedra
- ...


Things you ought to know
========================

1. Make sure this isn't what you want: [cgal-bindings](https://code.google.com/p/cgal-bindings/)
2. Rice is for Mac and Linux only
3. This code contains little or no comments.  Sorry, I'll try and be nicer about that.
